			<a href="http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Durotan" class="href1"><img src= "img/wiki.png" alt="" class="wiki"></a>
				<p>Durotan, son of Garad, was the chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, mate of Draka and father of the future Warchief Thrall. He was also a contemporary of Orgrim Doomhammer.</p>
				<p>Durotan was the heir apparent to Garad, chieftain of the Frostwolf clan, in the years prior to the First War. He cared deeply about the world and those living in it. This sensitivity could have been the signs of being a Shaman, but for Durotan it was just the way he was.</p>

				<p>Gul'dan of the Stormreaver Clan was a former orcish shaman of the Shadowmoon Clan from Draenor, who became the first orcish warlock as well as the founder of the Orcish Horde.</p>
				<p>Abandoning the ways of shamanism and betraying both his people and his mentor to the demon-lord Kil'jaeden for personal gain and power, Gul'dan was directly responsible for the orcs' fall to demonic enslavement as well as for the Horde's invasion of Azeroth.</p>
